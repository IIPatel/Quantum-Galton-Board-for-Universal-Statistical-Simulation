# Quantum-Galton-Board-for-Universal-Statistical-Simulation
This project addresses the WISER 2025 Quantum Projects challenge to develop resource-lean quantum algorithms for Monte Carlo-like statistical simulations, specifically focusing on the implementation and generalization of a Quantum Galton Board (QGB) as a "Universal Statistical Simulator."
